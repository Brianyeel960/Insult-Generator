# Instructions  

ðŸ§© Write a function called generateInsult() that 

1. calls Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length) for each of the three arrays.

2. Save each random index number that you generate into a separate variable <bodyPartIndex>, <adjectiveIndex>, and <wordIndex>

3. Create a variable called <bodyPart> and save a random bodyPart from your "randomBodyParts" array to it using bracket syntax and the <bodyPartIndex> you created in steps 1 & 2.

4. Repeat step 3 for variables called <adjective> and <word>

5. Then, concatenate the three variables into one string that will say "Your <bodyPart> is like a <adjective> <word>!" and save into a variable called <insult>

6. Replace the string "Unwritten insult" with your <insult> variable 

7. Click the pig to generate a random insult!
